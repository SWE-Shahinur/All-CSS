    <p>All the festivals have lost charm due to worldâ€™s encounter 
     with the lethal coronavirus in 2019. People miss the ambiance
     and joy of their favourite festivals - be these religious or cultural.
     Makar Sankranti is also called the Uttarayan or the beginning of the 
     time when the sun begins its northward journey. From this period the
      days begin to grow longer. This festival is more of a cultural festival
       than a religious one observed by the people of all walks of life in India since long.</p>
     <div>The festival is known by different names across the region. 
        In Bangladesh and West Bengal of India, it is known as Poush Sankranti,
         Makar Sankranti in Karnataka, Vihu in Assam, Pongal in Tamil Nadu. From this period the
         days begin to grow longer. This festival is more of a cultural festival
          than a religious one observed by the people of all walks of life in India since long. </div>
